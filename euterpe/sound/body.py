    freqs, decays, amps: each mode's frequency (Hz), its time to fall 60 dB (s) and its gain at
    its own frequency. Each resonator is a two-pole band-pass with zeros at 0 Hz and at half the
    sample rate, so a mode boosts its band and leaves the string's lowest drift alone.
    dry: how much of the string reaches the ear directly.

    Its limit: a real body has hundreds of modes, spread and coupled; a few of them give the low
    resonance (the air in the box, the top plate) but not the body's whole colour.
