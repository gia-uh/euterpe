    meet at the bow, where friction between hair and string acts every sample. While the
    string moves with the bow it sticks; when their velocities part by more than the friction
    holds, it slips. A smooth friction curve, (0.75 + |s * dv|) ** -4 between 0.01 and 0.98
    for a velocity difference dv, decides how much of the bow's motion passes into the string;
    more force lowers s, which flattens the curve and widens the sticking. The nut reflects with -1, the bridge with
    -damping through a one-pole low-pass set by brightness. The output is the wave arriving at
    the bridge, the string's velocity there.

    The spectrum, in the stable stick-slip motion: every harmonic of freq, falling about 1 / k
    like a sawtooth, with dips at the harmonics whose node falls on the bow (every 8th at
    position 0.125). brightness (0 to 1) sets how fast the high harmonics lose energy on each
    trip. Too little force for the speed loses the fundamental to a thin whistle of upper
    partials; too much and the note turns raucous. speed (0 to 1) is the bow's velocity and
    sets the amplitude; at 0 the bow rests on the string, which rings down. A small noise in
    the friction, about -40 dB and drawn from seed, is the rosin's uneven grip.

    position (a fraction of the length from the bridge), damping (the bridge's loss per trip)
    and brightness fix the loop and take numbers only. freq, force and speed may move every
    sample; position is clipped to 0 to 0.5, freq to 20 Hz and above, and a line shorter than one sample (freq
    above about RATE * position) is held at one sample, out of tune. It sounds while driven:
    an instrument bounds it with an envelope.
