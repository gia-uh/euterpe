    one period long, and on each trip an averaging filter takes away some of its high

    The burst is one period of noise with set levels: every harmonic of freq at a random phase
    drawn from seed, the k-th at 1 / (1 + (k / 2 ** (8 * brightness)) ** 2), at an RMS of 0.25
    (less for the few bright, combed bursts whose peak would pass 0.9).
    Raw noise would give each harmonic a random level, so the note's tone and loudness would
    change with the seed. The spectrum is the harmonics of freq. They start as bright as the
    burst (brightness 0 falls about 1/k², like a string pulled into a triangle; 1 is flat up to
    the 256th harmonic) and die away, the high ones sooner than the low ones, as in a real
    string. damping, the gain of one trip (0.9 to 0.9999 are useful), sets how long the note rings.
    position (0 to 0.5) is where the string is plucked, as a fraction of its length: it removes
    the harmonics with a node there, so 0.5, the middle, removes the even ones; 0 removes none.
    A first-order allpass in the loop adds the fraction of a sample the delay line cannot, so
    the pitch is exact. All parameters are numbers: a string's length is set when it is plucked.
    The loop needs at least one sample of delay line, so freq is at most 30 000 Hz, and it rings
    forever unless 0 < damping < 1.
