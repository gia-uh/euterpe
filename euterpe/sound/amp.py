    bass, mid and treble dB) and level.

    Low gain passes the string almost unchanged (clean); around 5 to 10 the louder parts bend
    (crunch); above 20 every note is pushed deep into the curve (lead). The bend adds odd and,
    through the bias, even harmonics of every note, and sums and differences between notes
    played together: a fifth's land on the harmonic series of a note an octave below the root,
    a third's do not. The highpass keeps the low strings from pushing the curve more than the
    high ones, as an amp's input stage does.

    Limit: the bend is the same at every level and frequency; a real amp also sags under a loud
    chord and its power stage and speaker distort too. Without a Cabinet after it, high gain
    sounds harsh: the curve's harmonics reach far above what a guitar speaker plays.
