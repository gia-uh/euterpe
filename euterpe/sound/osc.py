"""Band-limited oscillators: sine, saw, square and triangle.

The phase is a 32-bit fixed-point accumulator carried across blocks, so the
samples are the same in any block size. Saw and square jump once or twice per
cycle; a jump has energy at every frequency, and the part above half the sample
rate would fold back as aliasing. polyBLEP (a polynomial band-limited step)
replaces the two samples around each jump with a smoothed step, which removes
most of that energy. Samples whose frequency is at or above RATE / 2 (either sign) are zero.
