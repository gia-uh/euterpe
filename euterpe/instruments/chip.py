"""The sound chip of an 1980s handheld console: two pulse channels, a wave channel and a noise
channel, played in its classic limits or in a modern style with smooth volume and effects.

a fixed clock divided by a whole number sets each pitch, volume moves in 16 steps, the wave
channel plays 32 steps of 4 bits, and the noise comes from a 15- or 7-bit shift register.
