    partials lie at 1, 6.267 and 17.55 times its pitch, far apart and inharmonic; that hollow,
    slightly indistinct tone is what tells it from a marimba, whose bar has a near-harmonic
    2.756. The box's air and wood modes colour the stroke. A stroke names its tongue by pitch,
    and each tongue is its own resource, so a new stroke on it stops the one still ringing.

    tine: the modes, as ratios to the tongue's pitch. decay: the fundamental's seconds to fall
    60 dB at C2; a higher tongue is shorter and dies faster, by the square root of the pitch
    ratio. body: the Soundboard the tongues sound through, or None for a bare tongue.
    thump: how loud the fingertip's low knock on the box is. tolerance: each tongue's fixed
    small flaws, drawn from the seed.

    Limit: a real tongue's mounting is neither clamped nor free, and its pitch drifts with how
    hard the finger presses; the box is three modes, not the hundred a wooden cavity has.
